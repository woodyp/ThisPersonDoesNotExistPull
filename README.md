# This Person Does Not Exist Pull

This quick and dirty project will pull images from the thispersondoesnotexist.com site

I would hate if this was overused but I love the idea of having images of people that I don't have to worry about being real for demos. So as soon as I saw thispersondoesnotexist.com I created this quick app that will grab an image from the site and would save them locally.

I could see all types of improvements for this like different command line options etc but this works for me.

**Note**: most of this code was totally solen from [Avinash.S.Tiwari](https://forums.asp.net/members/qwe123kids.aspx) with his post [Image Tag Src To Save To Server using C#](https://forums.asp.net/t/1416226.aspx?Image+tag+src+to+save+to+server+using+C+Net) thank you Avinash
