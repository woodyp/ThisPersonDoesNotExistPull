# This Person Does Not Exist Pull

This quick and dirty project will pull images from the thispersondoesnotexist.com site

I would hate if this was overused but I love the idea of having images of people that I don't have to worry about being real for demos. So as soon as I saw thispersondoesnotexist.com I created this quick app that will grab an image from the site and would save them locally.

I could see all types of improvements for this like different command line options etc but this works for me.
